The Tabernacle in the Wilderness - The book of Exodus describes how the Israelites built a portable sanctuary called the Tabernacle in the wilderness after leaving Egypt. According to Jewish tradition, the Shekhinah presence dwelled within the Tabernacle, specifically in the innermost chamber known as the Holy of Holies.This sacred space was believed to be the location where the Israelites could communicate with God, and where the High Priest would enter once a year on Yom Kippur to seek forgiveness for the sins of the people. The book of Exodus states, "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" (Exodus 40:34).

The Temple was the center of Jewish worship, and during the dedication of the First Temple, the Shekhinah presence descended and filled the Temple. The Book of Kings describes the event as a cloud filling the house of the Lord, so much so that the priests could not stand to minister. The manifestation of the Shekhinah presence serves as a reminder of God's presence and involvement in the lives of His people.
