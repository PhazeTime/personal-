One view is that Jesus' response was intended to reveal the universal nature of his message. By framing his mission in terms of serving the "children of Israel," Jesus was challenging the narrow-minded views of his contemporaries who believed that God's grace was limited to a chosen few. In this interpretation, Jesus was not being dismissive of the woman's request, but rather demonstrating that his mission transcended ethnic and religious boundaries.
Those who see Jesus' reply as a test of the woman's faith argue that his initial rejection was not a reflection of prejudice or lack of compassion, but rather a way to draw out the woman's persistence and faith. This view is supported by the fact that Jesus ultimately grants the woman's request and praises her faith, stating that her daughter has been healed. According to this interpretation, Jesus was using this encounter as an opportunity to teach his disciples about the nature of faith and the importance of persistence in prayer.
